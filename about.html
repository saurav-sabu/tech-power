          <p>There are a variety of legal types of organizations, including corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, political organizations, international organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and educational institutions.

            A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector simultaneously, fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities.
            
            A voluntary association is an organization consisting of volunteers. Such organizations may be able to operate without legal formalities, depending on jurisdiction, including informal clubs or coordinating bodies with a goal in mind which they may express in the form of an manifesto, mission statement, or in an informal manner reflected in what they do because remember every action done by an organization both legal and illegal reflects a goal in mind.[1][2]
            
            Organizations may also operate secretly or illegally in the case of secret societies, criminal organizations and resistance movements. And in some cases may have obstacles from other organizations (ex: MLK's organization)[3] but what makes an organization an organization is not the paperwork that makes it official but to be an organization there must be four things:
            
            A goal in mind
            A leader or committee making the decision
            action involved
            communication and members.
            But what makes an organization recognized by the government is either filling out Incorporation (business) or recognition in the form of either societal pressure (ex: Advocacy group), causing concerns (ex: Resistance movement) or being considered the spokesperson of a group of people subject to negotiation (ex: the Polisario Front being recognized as the sole representative of the Sahawri people and forming a partially recognized state.)
            
            Compare the concept of social groups, which may include non-organizations.[4]</p>
